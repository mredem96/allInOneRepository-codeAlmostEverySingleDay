"During my activity as a music critic, theoretical writer and observer of all things concerning creative music, few times I have met such a young musician so commited to discover new things and learn new techniques and vocabularies, developing his music further and further with a rare focus and perseverance. Tiago Morgado was a real surprise when I first heard him play, some years ago, connecting his viola to a laptop computer and some effect pedals, and he continues to be. Considering the almost solitary conditions of his work, and living in a city far away from the main experimental / improvised / contemporary music circuits in Portugal, mostly concentrated in Lisbon and Oporto, it was kind of a miracle to have someone doing what he did the way he did it. Only a very special person was able of such enterprise, moved by a never ending curiosity and a purpose in life. Since then I’m always keeping me informed of what he’s doing and how are his studies abroad, knowing that he will be, in a near future, a very important musician not only in my country, but also in Europe and the world. That’s why I don’t have any hesitations in saying that Tiago Morgado deserves any support coming from cultural institutions. I’m sure the reward will be fullfiling, in terms of compositions, recordings, performances and projects under his name."
