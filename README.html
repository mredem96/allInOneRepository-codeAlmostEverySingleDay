<h1> All in One Repository / Code Almost Every Single Day</h1><br/><br/>
<p><h2>the mostivation behind this repository lies within:</h2><br/>
<i> - making a collection of most of the stuff i've been doing within the past year in terms of opensource development </i><br/>
<i> - coding almost every single day until becoming fully proficient on software engineering </i><br/><br/></p>
<p><b>the motivation for that is to derive various projects out of a single eco-system</b></p>
