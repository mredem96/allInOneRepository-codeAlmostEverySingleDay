<h1>idea 5</h1>

<h2>developing c++ live electronics and algorothmic composition toolbox. should be able to:</h2>

- use next generation state of art machine learning algorithmics implemented in tensorflow such as deep convolutional recursive swarm of hybrids bdi and ann;
- using elasticfusion orbit slam2 as an input for gesture recognition by using computer vision;
- using gpgpu driven fft for audio digital signal processing, and gesture recognition, and audio feature extraction;
- computing audio in non real time using complex gpgpu transformations
- using raya as a sound spatialization gpgpu engine
- using id tech 4 as the render context for my visuals
