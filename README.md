# Code Almost Every Single Day

code almost every single day until becoming fully proficient on software engineering

if I manage to do so, making sense of them as libraries and frameworks, although that is secondary.

current work in progress projects:

- library of cpp math expressions
- developing c++ live electronics and algorothmic composition toolbox

# relevant examples

if you want to check the work i did here, i recommend you to go to:

- 24.cpp, 21.py, 15.sh, 20.cpp
- freecodecamp tribute page
