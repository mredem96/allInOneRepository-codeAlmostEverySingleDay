# All in One Repository / Code Almost Every Single Day

the mostivation behind this repository lies within:
- making a collection of most of the stuff i've been doing within the past year in terms of opensource development
- coding almost every single day until becoming fully proficient on software engineering

the motivation for that is to derive various projects out of a single eco-system

if I manage to do so, making sense of them as libraries and frameworks, although that is secondary.

current work in progress projects:

- library of cpp math expressions
- developing c++ live electronics and algorothmic composition toolbox
