<h1> All in One Repository / Code Almost Every Single Day</h1>

<h2>the mostivation behind this repository lies within:</h2>
- <i>making a collection of most of the stuff i've been doing within the past year in terms of opensource development</i>
- <i>coding almost every single day until becoming fully proficient on software engineering</i>

<b>the motivation for that is to derive various projects out of a single eco-system</b>
