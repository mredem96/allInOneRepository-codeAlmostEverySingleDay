MY UBBER ALGORITHM

1.1 SET UP A SILENCE THRESHOLD IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH APERIODIC IRREGULAR MATERIAL
1.2 FOR PHRASES THE SILENCE THRESHOLD SHOULD BE 500 MS
1.3 FOR SECTIONS THE SILENCE THRESHOLD SHOULD BE 4000MS

2.1 GRAB A SET OF FOUR SPECTRAL CLASSIFIERS (CAN BE SOMETHING LIKE PITCH, LOUDNESS, NOISINESS, AND BRIGHTNESS, ENERGY, WHAHTEVER)
2.2 CALCULATE DENSITY PERDIOCITY AND REGULARITY OF EVENTS:
2.3 SET A PULSE FOR STORING 2ND ORDER EVENTS, CALCULATE THE DIFFERENCE OF TIME AMONG THEM, AND PULL THE VALUES OUT
2.4 APPLY THE ALGORITHM RECURSIVELY

3.1 CREATE A VECTOR. IN THIS CASE SHOULD BE A 12 OR 15 SIZE VECTOR.
3.2 STORE VALUES THERE
3.3 SERIALIZE THE VALUES BY USING A COMPLEX (DE-)ENCYRPTION ALGORITHM TO GET HIGHER RESOLUTION OF EVENTS
3.4 GET AN INDEX, MAP THAT INDEX TO AN OUTPUT

4.1 SOMETHING INTERESTING YOU CAN DO IS TO TRAIN YOURSELF IMPROVISING, USING A MARKOV 2ND OR 3RD ORDER, TRAIN IT AND FIGURING OUT A MEAN OF PREDICTING A DESIRED OUTPUT

5.1 SOMETHING EVEN MORE INTERESTING YOU CAN DO IS AFTER PROTOTYPING ALL THE PROCESS, IMPLEMENT WITH GGIT.CATCH AND GGIT.RELEASE IN MAXMSP TO COMPUTE IT WITH GEN~ AND CREATING MEANS OF OUTPUTIGN OPENGL OPTIMEZ CODE OUT OF VERY DUMB STUFF

6.1 NOW YOU HAVE THE DATA. CREATE SOME INTERESTING MUSIC WITH IT

7.1 AGGREGATE THESE PIECES TO CREATE A SYSTEM

8.1 APPLY THIS MODEL TO WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO RANGING FROM STOCK MARKET TO WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK ABOUT

9.1 IMPROVISE A LOT. THINGS ARE ALWAYS A CHANGING AND AN IDEA CAN SEEM BEAUTIFUL ON PAPER AND TAKE A LOT FO TIME TO REFINE AND MATERIALIZE ON A BRPOER WAY

PS: I INITIATLLY TRIED TO CREATE SOME EVENTS WITH PITCH AND RHTYHM ANALYSIS, YOU CAN DO THIS BY CREATING AN INTEGRATOR THAT WILL OFFESET TA  BUFFER OT TIME AND PITCH VALUES TO CREATE AN AVERAGE AND DEALING WITH STUFF

10.1 YOU CAN OF COURSE ADAPT THIS MODEL FOR CREATING A LIVE ELECTRONICS ECOSYSTEM THAT CAN BE MODULARLY USED TO BE ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT TO CONTENXTS
