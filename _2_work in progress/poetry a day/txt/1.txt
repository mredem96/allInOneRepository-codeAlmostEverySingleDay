Even here, at that very moment, when I cried glowing wounds to the gods, in which I prostrated myself under the face of the darkness in me, I manifested the desperate sense of who counts the shadows of the face of evil, which is as it says, back in Babylon , Through the seed of the desert, death is the light that glows life. I fall on top of myself, I groan in the darkness, I revolt against everything and everyone, I say evil of myself, I fall under the face of death, as one who wants to miserably bring the divine and megaonic breath of divine acacia. You have no one to share the suffering and the pain you feel, you have fallen on yourself, on life, on love, run in time, quays, you stumble, but never rise, confessed to angels and demons, That in death you find the ultimate meaning of life, which is in the seed of chaos and destruction, which regenerates the sense of the sephirotic pulsar of humanity. That it is in a delinquency of affections eaten up by your own suffering that you show the angels that you are dead.
