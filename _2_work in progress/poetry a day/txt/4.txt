The jail of life that leads us to death
Through the cleansing of a graveyard of dreams
Who break, tear, tie, and are there dead;
I walk through a black Danube, bound to you
Through the latent breath in the dawn's gorge
What is the dietary anaphora between Venus, Saturn and Mercury
It is a rosette in flames in the mouth of the beast,
It is the breath of the abyss, it is as much as you tell me,
As far as you lie to me, so that already there,
Through the glow of the hours, between
Dietary vertigo, and arsenic spirals
Caught up in the mouth of the beast, all there dissemble,
Everything there is broken, everything there ends.
I die today, here, between the end of days,
To be reborn tomorrow, between concealment
From a sentinel of dead affections between regret
