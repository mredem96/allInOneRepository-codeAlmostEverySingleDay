# Code Almost Every Single Day

code almost every single day until becoming fully proficient on software engineering

if I manage to do so, making sense of them as libraries and frameworks, although that is secondary.

current work in progress projects:

- library of cpp math expressions
- developing a cpp algorithmic composition framework

# relevant examples

if you want to check the work i did here, i recommend you to go to: 

- 24.cpp, 21.py, 15.sh, 20.cpp
- freecodecamp tribute page

	- System programming refers to writing code that tasks advantage of operating system support for programmers. This course is designed to introduce you to system programming. By the end of this course, you should be proficient at writing programs that take full advantage of operating system support. To be concrete, we need to fix an operating system and we need to choose a programming language for writing programs. We chose the C language running on a Linux/UNIX operating system (which implements the POSIX standard interface between the programmer and the OS).

	- Write a real-time OS microkernel in C, and application code to operate a model train set in response to real-time sensor information. The communication with the train set runs at 2400 baud so it takes about 61 milliseconds to ask all of the sensors for data about the train's possible location.  This makes it particularly challenging because a train can move about 3 centimeters in that time. One of the most challenging and time-consuming courses at the University of Waterloo.

	- This is a course on the study, design, and implementation of programming languages.
	- The course works at two simultaneous levels: first, we will use a programming language that can demonstrate a wide variety of programming paradigms. Second, using this language, we will learn about the mechanics behind programming languages by implementing our own language(s). The two level approach usually means that we will often see how to use a certain feature, and continue by implementing it.

	- Perl, PHP, JavaScript, VisualBasic -- they are often-requested skills for employment, but most of us do not have the time to find out what they are all about. In this course, you learn how to use scripting languages for rapid prototyping, web programming, data processing, and application extension. Besides covering traditional programming languages concepts as they apply to scripting (e.g., dynamic typing and scoping), this course looks at new concepts rarely found in traditional languages (e.g., string interpolation, hashes, and polylingual code). Through a series of small projects, you use different languages to achieve programming tasks that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of scripting. As a side effect, you practice teaching yourself new languages.

	- Types and Semantics is about designing and understand programming languages, whether they be domain specific or general purpose. The goal of this class is to provide a variety of tools for designing custom (programming) languages for whatever task is at hand. Part of that will be a variety of insights on how languages work along with experiences from working with academics and industry on creating new languages such as Ceylon and Kotlin. The class focuses on types and semantics and the interplay between them. This means category theory and constructive type theory (e.g. Coq and richer variations) are ancillary topics of the class. The class also covers unconventional semantic domains such as classical linear type theory in order to both break students from convential thinking and to provide powerful targets capable of formalizing thinks like networking protocols, resource-sensitive computation, and concurrency constructs. The class project is to design and formalize a (programming) language for a purpose of the student's choosing, and assignments are designed to ensure students have had a chance to practice applying the techniques learned in class before culminating these skills in the class project.

	- Teaches understanding of how a modern compiler is structured and the major algorithms that are used to translate code from high-level to machine language. The best way to do this is to actually build a working compiler, so there will be a significant project to implement one that translates programs written in a core subset of Java into executable x86 assembly language. The compilers themselves will use scanner and parser generator tools and the default implementation language is Java.

*CUNY Hunter College*
	- It is currently an intensive introduction to program development and problem solving. Its emphasis is on the process of designing, implementing, and evaluating small-scale programs. It is not supposed to be a C++ programming course, although much of the course is spent on the details of C++. C++ is an extremely large and complex programming language with many features that interact in unexpected ways. One does not need to know even half of the language to use it well.

	- This course is a first-year graduate course in algorithms. Emphasis is placed on fundamental algorithms and advanced methods of algorithmic design, analysis, and implementation. Techniques to be covered include amortization, randomization, fingerprinting, word-level parallelism, bit scaling, dynamic programming, network flow, linear programming, fixed-parameter algorithms, and approximation algorithms. Domains include string algorithms, network optimization, parallel algorithms, computational geometry, online algorithms, external memory, cache, and streaming algorithms, and data structures. The need for efficient algorithms arises in nearly every area of computer science. But the type of problem to be solved, the notion of what algorithms are "efficient,'' and even the model of computation can vary widely from area to area. In this second class in algorithms, we will survey many of the techniques that apply broadly in the design of efficient algorithms, and study their application in a wide range of application domains and computational models. The goal is for the class to be broad rather than deep. Our plan is to touch upon the following areas. This is a tentative list of topics that might be covered in the class; we will select material adaptively based on the background, interests, and rate of progress of the students.

	-  This graduate course gives a broad introduction to complexity theory, including classical results and recent developments. Complexity theory aims to understand the power of efficient computation (when computational resources like time and space are limited). Many compelling conceptual questions arise in this context. Most of these questions are (surprisingly?) difficult and far from being resolved. Nevertheless, a lot of progress has been made toward understanding them (and also why they are difficult). We will learn about these advances in this course. A theme will be combinatorial constructions with random-like properties, e.g., expander graphs and error-correcting codes. Some examples:
		-  Is finding a solution inherently more difficult than verifying it?
		-  Do more computational resources mean more computing power?
		-  Is it easier to find approximate solutions than exact ones?
		-  Are randomized algorithms more powerful than deterministic ones?
		-  Is it easier to solve problems in the average case than in the worst case?
		-  Are quantum computers more powerful than classical ones?

	- In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular 	programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.

	- Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Understanding complex language utterances is also a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, customer service, language translation, radiology reports, etc. There are a large variety of underlying tasks and machine learning models powering NLP applications. Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP.

	- The Web continues to grow in popularity as platform for retail transactions, financial services, and rapidly evolving forms of communication. It is becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers who wish to compromise users' systems or steal data from other sites. Browser vendors must stay ahead of these attacks by providing features that support secure web applications. This course will study vulnerabilities in existing web browsers and the applications they render, as well as new technologies that enable web applications that were never before possible. The material will be largely based on current research problems, and students will be expected to criticize and improve existing defenses. Topics of study include (but are not limited to) browser encryption, JavaScript security, plug-in security, sandboxing, web mashups, and authentication.

It treats such aspects of thinking as vision, language, learning, reasoning, memory, consciousness, ideals, emotions, and personality. It incorporates ideas from psychology, artificial intelligence, and computer science to resolve theoretical issues such as wholes vs. parts, structural vs. functional descriptions, declarative vs. procedural representations, symbolic vs. connectionist models, and logical vs. common-sense theories of learning.

    - This is an undergraduate level course covering the fundamental concepts of networking as embodied in the Internet. The course will cover a wide range of topics; see the lecture schedule for more details. While the class has a textbook, we will not follow its order of presentation but will instead use the text as a reference when covering each individual topic. The course will also have several projects that involve programming (in Python). 
    - You should know programming, data structures, and software engineering. In terms of mathematics, your algebra should be very solid, you need to know basic probability, and you should be comfortable with thinking abstractly. The TAs will spend very little time reviewing material that is not specific to networking. We assume that you either know the material covered in those courses, or are willing to learn the material as necessary. We won't cover any of this material in lecture.

	- CS262a is the first semester of a year-long sequence on computer systems research, including operating systems, database systems, and Internet infrastructure systems.  The goal of the course is to cover a broad array of research topics in computer systems, and to engage you in top-flight systems research.  The first semester is devoted to basic thematic issues and underlying techniques in computer systems, while the second semester goes deeper into topics related to scalable, parallel and distributed systems.  The class is based on a discussion of important research papers and a research project.  
	- **Parts**: Some Classics, Persistent Storage, Concurrency, Higher-Level Models, Virtual Machines, Cloud Computing, Parallel and Distributed Computing, Potpourri.   
	- Prerequisites: The historical prerequisite was to pass an entrance exam in class, which covered undergraduate operating systems material (similar to [UCB's CS162](https://cs162.eecs.berkeley.edu/)). There is no longer an exam. However, if you have not already taken a decent undergrad OS class, you should talk with me before taking this class. The exam had the benefit of "paging in" the undergrad material, which may have been its primary value (since the pass rate was high).

	-  Hardware that exploits quantum phenomena can dramatically alter the nature of computation. Though constructing a working quantum computer is a formidable technological challenge, there has been much recent experimental progress. In addition, the theory of quantum computation is of interest in itself, offering strikingly different perspectives on the nature of computation and information, as well as providing novel insights into the conceptual puzzles posed by the quantum theory. The course is intended both for physicists, unfamiliar with computational complexity theory or cryptography, and also for computer scientists and mathematicians, unfamiliar with quantum mechanics. The prerequisites are familiarity (and comfort) with finite dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers, some standard group theory, and ability to count in binary.

	- CS5540 is a masters-level course that covers a wide range of clinical problems and their associated computational challenges. The practice of medicine is filled with digitally accessible information about patients, ranging from EKG readings to MRI images to electronic health records. This poses a huge opportunity for computer tools that make sense out of this data. Computation tools can be used to answer seemingly straightforward questions about a single patient's test results (“Does this patient have a normal heart rhythm?”), or to address vital questions about large populations (“Is there any clinical condition that affects the risks of Alzheimer”). In CS5540 we will look at many of the most important sources of clinical data and discuss the basic computational techniques used for their analysis, ranging in sophistication from current clinical practice to state-of-the-art research projects.

	- This course will cover advanced topics in evolutionary algorithms and their application to open-ended computational design. The field of evolutionary computation tries to address large-scale optimization and planning problems through stochastic population-based methods. It draws inspiration from evolutionary processes in nature and in engineering, and also serves as abstract models for these phenomena. Evolutionary processes are generally weak methods that require little information about the problem domain and hence can be applied across a wide variety of applications. They are especially useful for open-ended problem domains for which little formal knowledge exists and the number of parameters is undefined, such as for the general engineering design process. This course will provide insight to a variety of evolutionary computation paradigms, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies, as well as governing dynamics of co-evolution, arms races and mediocre stable states. New methods involving symbiosis models and pattern recognition will also be presented. The material will be intertwined with discussions of representations and results for design problems in a variety of problem domains including software, electronics, and mechanics.

	- CS6452 focuses on datacenter networks and services. The emerging demand for web services and cloud computing have created need for large scale data centers. The hardware and software infrastructure for datacenters critically determines the functionality, performance, cost and failure tolerance of applications running on that datacenter. This course will examine design alternatives for both the hardware (networking) infrastructure, and the software infrastructure for datacenters.

	- CS6630 is an introduction to physics-based rendering at the graduate level. Starting from the fundamentals of light transport we will look at formulations of the Rendering Equation, and a series of Monte Carlo methods, from sequential sampling to multiple importance sampling to Markov Chains, for solving the equation to make pictures. We'll look at light reflection from surfaces and scattering in volumes, illumination from luminaries and environments, and diffusion models for translucent materials. We will build working implementations of many of the algorithms we study, and learn how to make sure they are actually working correctly. It's fun to watch integrals and probability distributions transform into photographs of a slightly too perfect synthetic world.

	- This is a graduate course in scientific computing created and taught by [Oliver Serang](http://colorfulengineering.org/) in 2014, which covers topics in computer science and statistics with applications from biology. The course is designed top-down, starting with a problem and then deriving a variety of solutions from scratch.
	- Topics include memoization, recurrence closed forms, string matching (sorting, hash tables, radix tries, and suffix tries), dynamic programming (e.g. Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch), Bayesian statistics (e.g. the envelope paradox), graphical models (HMMs, Viterbi, junction tree, belief propagation), FFT, and the probabilistic convolution tree.

	- This is an introductory course on Networking for graduate students. It follows a top-down approach to teaching Computer Networks, so it starts with the Application layer which most of the students are familiar with and as the course unravels we learn more about transport, network and link layers of the protocol stack.
	- As far as prerequisites are concerned - basic computer, programming and probability theory background is required.
	- The course site contains links to the lecture videos, reading material and assignments.

  ## How to use this guide

  ### Order of the classes

  This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

  The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start the first course, [Introduction to Biology](), when you done with it, start the next one.

  **If the course is not open, do it with the archived resources or wait until next class is open.**

  ### How to track and show your progress

  1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
  1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/yax8Kgnh) board to your personal account. See how to copy a board [here](http://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally/).

  Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.

  We also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process. The meaning of each of these labels is:

  - `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
  - `Extra Courses`: cards with that label represent courses that was added by the student.
  - `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing.
  - `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.
  - `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum. Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column. You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.
  - `Extra Sections`: cards with that label represent sections that was added by the student.

  The intention of this board is to provide for our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the status of your board to be **public** or **private**.



  ### Should I take all courses?

  **Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here! Also we highly encourage you to complete more by reading papers and attending research projects after your coursework is done.

  ### Duration of the course

  It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular Bioinformatics course, but we can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

  You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

  > See more about "Commit to a process, not a goal" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

  ### Project Based

  Here in **OSS University**, you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!

  In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project** or write **papers and publish them** about your focus with Bioinformatics.

  > "What does it mean?"

  After finish a course, you should think about a **real world problem** that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.

  > This part needs upgrade:
    - The projects of all students will be listed in [this](https://github.com/open-source-society/help/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) file. Submit your project's information in that file after you conclude it.
    - Research focused projects

    Put the OSSU-Bioinformatics badge in the README of your repository! [![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)

    - Markdown: `[![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics ](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics)`
    - HTML: `<a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics"><img alt="Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg"></a>`

  **You can create this project alone or with other students!**

  #### Project Suggestions
  1. (Add Suggestions Here)


  And you should also...

  ### Be creative!

  This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.

  You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate **and this is what really matters**!

  In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!

  Here are some tips about how you can do that:

  - **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.
  - **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.

  ### Cooperative work

  **We love cooperative work**! Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

  ### Which programming languages should I use?

  List of skills:
  - C/C++
  - Unix System
  - Python/Perl
  - R
  - Algorithms

  These skills mentioned above are the very essential tool set that bioinformatician and computational biologist depends on.

  The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

  ### Content Policy

  You must share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

  [Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:

  # Summary

  The OSSU curriculum is a **complete education in computer science** using online materials.
  It's not merely for career training or professional development.
  It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines,
  and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
  but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

  It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements,
  as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.
  The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.,
  but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

  **Courses must**:
  - Be open for enrollment
  - Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running at least once a month or so)
  - Fulfill the [academic requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) of OSSU
  - Fit neatly into the progression of the curriculum with respect to topics and difficulty level
  - Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles

  When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book.
  When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
  they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

  **Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
  - *Intro CS*: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them
  - *Core CS*: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take
  - *Advanced CS*: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests
  - *Final Project*: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide
  - *Pro CS*: graduate-level specializations students can elect to take after completing the above curriculum if they want to maximize their chances of getting a good job

  **Duration**. It is possible to finish Core CS within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 18-22 hours/week to your studies.
  Courses in Core CS should be taken linearly if possible, but since a perfectly linear progression is rarely possible,
  each class's prerequisites is specified so that you can design a logical but non-linear progression
  based on the class schedules and your own life plans.

  **Cost**. All or nearly all course material prior to Pro CS is available for free,
  however some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
  Note that Coursera offers [financial aid](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid).
  Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
  just remember that you can't purchase success!

  **Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
  *Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct* that you signed in the beginning of each course!

  **How to contribute**. Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

  ## Prerequisites

  - [Core CS](#core-cs) assumes the student has already taken high school math and physics, including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus.
  Some high school graduates will have already taken AP Calculus, but this is usually only about 3/4 of a college calculus class, so the calculus courses in the curriculum are still recommended.
  - [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
  and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.
  - Note that [Advanced systems](#advanced-systems) assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

  ## Introduction to Computer Science

  ## Advanced CS

  After completing **every required course** in Core CS, students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest.
  Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
  But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

  The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications).
  A Specialization's Capstone, if taken, may act as the [Final project](#final-project), if permitted by the Honor Code of the course.
  If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.

  ### Advanced programming

  **Topics covered**:

  ### Advanced applications

  These Coursera Specializations all end with a Capstone project.
  Depending on the course, you may be able to utilize the Capstone as your Final Project for this Computer Science curriculum.
  Note that doing a Specialization with the Capstone at the end always costs money.
  So if you don't wish to spend money or use the Capstone as your Final, it may be possible to take the courses in the Specialization for free by manually searching for them, but not all allow this.

  ## Final project

  OSS University is **project-focused**.
  You are encouraged to do the assignments and exams for each course, but what really matters is whether you can *use* your knowledge to solve a real world problem.

  After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
  Not only does real project work look great on a resume, the project will *validate* and *consolidate* your knowledge.
  You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like
  [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
  or
  [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

  Another option is using the Capstone project from taking one of the Specializations in [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications);
  whether or not this makes sense depends on the course, the project, and whether or not the course's Honor Code permits you to display your work publicly.
  In some cases, it may not be permitted;
  do **not** violate your course's Honor Code!

  Put the OSSU-CS badge in the README of your repository!
  [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)

  - Markdown: `[![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)`

  ### Evaluation

  Upon completing your final project, submit your project's information to [PROJECTS](PROJECTS.md)
  via a pull request and use our [community](#community) channels to announce it to your fellow students.

  Your peers and mentors from OSSU will then informally evaluate your project.
  You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense — everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success.
  The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a computer scientist,
  and to get experience listening to feedback — both positive and negative — and taking it in stride.

  The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether OSSU,
  through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world-class computer science education.

  ### Cooperative work

  You can create this project alone or with other students!
  **We love cooperative work**!
  Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

  ### Which programming languages should I use?

  My friend, here is the best part of liberty!
  You can use **any** language that you want to complete the final project.

  The important thing is to **internalize** the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

  ## Pro CS

  After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science, or quite close to one.
  You can stop in the Advanced CS section, but the next step to completing your studies is to develop skills and knowledge in a specific domain.
  Many of these courses are graduate-level.

  Choose one or more of the following **specializations**:
  - [Mastering Software Development in R Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/r) by Johns Hopkins University
  - [Artificial Intelligence Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/ai) by IBM, Amazon, and Didi
  - [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) by kaggle
  - [Cybersecurity MicroMasters](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ritx-cybersecurity) by the Rochester Institute of Technology
  - [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) by Google

  These aren't the only specializations you can choose. Check the following websites for **more options**:
  - edX: [xSeries](https://www.edx.org/xseries)
  - Coursera: [Specializations](https://www.coursera.org/specializations)
  - Udacity: [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree)

  ### Where to go next?

  - Look for a job as a developer!
  - Check out the [readings](extras/readings.md) for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge.
  - Join a local developer meetup (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).
  - Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of software development, such as:
    - [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), a new functional programming language for the web based on the battle-tested Erlang Virtual Machine!
    - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a systems language which uses borrowing and lifetimes to achieve memory safety without a garbage collector!

  ## How to show your progress

  1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
  1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/9DPXYv5f) board to your personal account.
  See how to copy a board [here](http://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally/).

  Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.

  We also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process.
  The meaning of each of these labels is:

  - `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
  - `Extra Resources`: cards with that label represent courses that was added by the student.
  - `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing.
  - `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student.
  Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.
  - `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum.
  Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column.
  You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.

  The intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc.
  You can change the status of your board to be *public* or *private*.

  # Curated Computer Science Curriculum
  ## _How to Teach Yourself Computer Science: A Self Taught B.S. level CS Curriculum_

  ## Introduction
  There are tons of free online resources that will help you "Learn Programming Language X," but it's difficult to find courses that will give you a deeper understanding of computer science (CS) like what's taught in a bachelor's level CS program. There is a lot more to CS than what you get from learning languages or going to a webdev bootcamp, so this is an attempt to create self taught curriculum based on the most important courses you'd learn in a typical BS in CS program.

  Below you'll find a compilation of resources for teaching yourself the fundamentals of computer science. The categories are based largely off of the [undergraduate pre-requisites for a Master's in Computer Science](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/academics/grad/prereq), with a few extra items based on what seems to be important to the professional CS community. The content was found all over the place, but the wonderful folks at [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/) and [/r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) have been especially helpful.

  The curriculum is weighted towards interactive courses, followed by static courses with materials and sample exercises, followed by full texts. I've tried to avoid lists of YouTube videos and the like because it's harder to retain information from lectures. These are mostly free resources; however, I've included some books that are too useful not to mention.

  # Math:
  _Calculus, Statistics, Probability. Computer Science is a branch of mathematics after all._

  + [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - Tons of resources here, but the math courses in particular are convenient and accessible. Select the math you want to know (Probability and Statistics, and Calculus) and Khan Academy will test you and determine what you need to learn to get there.

  # Programming Fundamentals:
  _The basic concepts of computer science: object-oriented programming, control structures, abstraction etc._

  + [Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!) - Probably the most well supported MOOC ever. David Malan is a fantastic teacher,  and the class is elegantly put together with lots of videos, examples, and automatically graded assignments. Uses C++.

  _Optional:_
  + [Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Sweigart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - You are going to need to be familiar with Python, this course will introduce you to Python and teach you basic automation. Uses Python.

  # Miscellaneous Skills:
  _You don't have to master these skills, but a little knowledge will go a long way._
  ### _GitHub:_
  Git is a version control system for managing software development. Learn how to use git and maintain an active portfolio of your own projects and contributions to other projects on GitHub. Collaborating on open-source software is a great way to learn the invaluable skills of working with other people and writing readable code.

  + [Atlassian's Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) - Excellent intro tutorials on everything you need to get started with git.

  + [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) - More advanced interactive git tutorials.

  + [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) - Guides for using the various features of GitHub.

  ### _Touch Typing:_
  Programming requires a lot of typing. A small investment in typing skills will save tons of time down the road.

  + [Keybr.com](http://www.keybr.com/#!game) - This program offers the best combination of simplicity and effectiveness; it charts your progress and adjusts its difficulty accordingly.

  ### _Programming Languages:_
  You should be learning the fundamentals of programming through the other courses here, but sometimes you may need to pick up the syntax of a particular language.

  + [codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/learn) - Quick, basic lessons in a number of popular languages and systems.

  + [Michael Lee's Curated Programming Resources](https://github.com/Michael0x2a/curated-programming-resources/blob/master/resources.md#programming-languages) - A bunch of material for a bunch of languages.

  ### _Stack Exchange_
  An incredibly useful network of Q&A sites for getting help, it's like Yahoo Answers for people who know what they are talking about. The site is engineered to be as helpful as possible, but it may take a little getting used to. [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=) is dedicated to programming questions.

  + [Meta Stack Exchange FAQ](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7931/faq-for-stack-exchange-sites) - Explains the stack exchange system and how to use it successfully.

  + [Stack Overflow's Help Center](http://stackoverflow.com/help) - Stack Overflow is for programming questions, the help center will be your guide. Take the tour if you've never used it before.

  # Discrete Structures:

  ## About

  This is a **solid path** for those of you who want to complete a **Data Science** course on your own time, **for free**, with courses from the **best universities** in the World.

  In our curriculum, we give preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because these courses were created with our style of learning in mind.

  ## Becoming an OSS student

  To officially register for this course you must create a profile in our [web app](https://ossu.firebaseapp.com).

  **ps**: Currently, the web app is for tracking the progress of the [Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) path, but we are working to extend this functionality for all of our courses. Thanks for the comprehension.

  > **"How can I do this?"**

  Just create an account on GitHub and log in with this account in our web app.

  The intention of this app is to offer for our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc.

  In the "My Progress" tab, you are able to edit the status of the courses that you are taking, and also add the link of your final project for each one.

  ## Motivation & Preparation

  Here are two interesting links that can make **all** the difference in your journey.

  The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", which consists of learning the entire **4-year** MIT curriculum for Computer Science in **1 year**.

  - [MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)

  The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are **fundamental abilities** to succeed in our journey.

  - [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)

  ## Self Learning vs Mentor Guided Program

  We believe that anyone with the right determination and dedication can teach themselves to be a Data Scientist. However, self learning can be difficult and often has it's own challenges. It demands a lot of time and self-descipline from the student. Also, some of us need a little push now and then to stay on track and make progress. If you can afford a 1:1 Expert Mentor guided program, we recommend:

  ![keep learning](http://i.imgur.com/REQK0VU.jpg)

  ## How to use this guide

  ### Order of the classes

  This guide was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.

  The courses are **already** in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the [Linear Algebra](#linear-algebra) section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.

  **If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.**

  ### Should I take all courses?

  **Yes!** The intention is to conclude **all** the courses listed here!

  ### Duration of the project

  It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a  regular Data Science course, but I can **guarantee** you that your **reward** will be proportional to **your motivation/dedication**!

  You must focus on your **habit**, and **forget** about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours **every day** studying this curriculum. If you do this, **inevitably** you'll finish this curriculum.

  > See more about "Commit to a process, not a goal" [here](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

  ### Project Based

  Here in **OSS University**, you do **not** need to take exams, because we are focused on **real projects**!

  In order to show for everyone that you **successfully** finished a course, you should create a **real project**.

  > "What does it mean?"

  After finish a course, you should think about a **real world problem** that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to **validate** and **consolidate** your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.

  The projects of all students will be listed in [this](https://github.com/open-source-society/data-science/blob/master/PROJECTS.md) file. Submit your project's information in that file after you conclude it.

  **You can create this project alone or with other students!**

  #### Project Suggestions



  And you should also...

  ### Be creative!

  This is a **crucial** part of your journey through all those courses.

  You **need** to have in mind that what you are able to **create** with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate **and this is what really matters**!

  In order to show that you **really** learned those things, you need to be **creative**!

  Here are some tips about how you can do that:

  - **Articles**: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.
  - **GitHub repository**: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.

  ### Cooperative work

  **We love cooperative work**! Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

  ### Which programming languages should I use?

  Python and R are heavily used in Data Science community and our courses teach you both, but...

  The **important** thing for each course is to **internalize** the **core concepts** and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

  ### Content Policy

  You must share **only** files that you are **allowed** to! **Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct** that you signed in the beginning of some courses.

  [Be creative](#be-creative) in order to show your progress! :smile:

  Exploring the performance of SGEMM in OpenCL on NVIDIA GPUs
  =============

  Date: 31-Oct-2014 - 07-Nov-2014

  Author: Cedric Nugteren, SURFsara (http://www.surfsara.nl)

  This repository contains multiple OpenCL implementations of single-precision generalised matrix-multiplication (SGEMM) tuned for an NVIDIA Tesla K40m GPU. The different versions (named myGEMM) are part of a step-by-step tutorial, in which each step adds a new optimisation. The different steps and the details of the OpenCL kernel codes are all explained in depth at https://cnugteren.github.io/tutorial/pages/page1.html.

  The OpenCL kernels can be used natively using the OpenCL framework. However, there is also a header-file included which converts the OpenCL kernels into CUDA syntax. This allows the same code to be tested through the CUDA-toolchain.

  Apart from the OpenCL kernel codes, this repository contains fully working host code, including a loop over different matrix sizes and different BLAS libraries. It contains code to run NVIDIA's cuBLAS as a reference and the open-source clBlas library.

  Pre-requisites:
  * A C++ compiler (tested with GCC and ICC)
  * The CUDA toolkit and NVCC compiler (tested with version 6.5)
  * OpenCL headers and libraries (part of the CUDA toolkit)

  Requirements to run the performance and correctness comparisons:
  * The cuBLAS library (part of the CUDA toolkit, tested version 6.5)
  * The open-source clBlas library (tested 2.2.0)

  Usage
  =============

  *	Compile the code:

  		make build

  	Compiles the benchmarking infrastructure and the myGEMM kernels. Make sure there is a "bin" and "obj" directory available. Note that you might have to edit the Makefile to set the proper locations of the CUDA and OpenCL installations on your system.

  *	Run the code:

  		make run

  	This runs the code for matrices ranging from MINSIZE to MAXSIZE (defined in src/common.h). It will run cuBLAS, clBlas, and the CUDA and OpenCL versions of the myGEMM kernels. The particular kernel to be executed is defined using the KERNEL keyword in src/settings.h. This file also contains other settings you might want to modify for your particular GPU.

  *	Inspect the code:

  		make inspect

  	This generates all kinds of assembly-like versions of the CUDA kernels in the "bin" subdirectory. It also prints out statistics of the kernels such as the register usage.

  Minimal working example
  =============

  Additionally, we supply the minimal.cpp file in the 'extra' directory. This file is a self-contained minimal working example (MWE) of the most basic SGEMM kernel (myGEMM1). This can be useful if you don't want to deal with Makefiles or don't have the CUDA, cuBLAS, or clBlas installed. Note that minimal.cpp misses some features compared to the main code, but we believe that it can nevertheless be a good starting point if you want to integrate myGEMM into your own code.

  The code can be compiled using a regular C++ compiler and only requires OpenCL installed. Example compilation from the root folder:

  	g++ -O3 -Wall -I/path/to/opencl/include extra/minimal.cpp -o bin/minimal -lOpenCL

  Be aware that the minimal working example does not:
  *	Iterate over multiple matrix sizes
  *	Compare performance with cuBLAS or clBlas
  *	Check for correctness of the results
  *	Check for OpenCL errors
  *	Load a kernel-file from disk, instead it is embedded as a string

  # OpenCL
  A repository for my experiments and various tutorials I might follow

  ## Install

  * opencl-headers

  # OpenCL-CUDA-Tutorials
  Sources for OpenCL and CUDA tutorials.

  This is as much a learning experience for me as it will be with you so bear with me. I try to comment my code and explain what I am doing to the best of my ability however I will not be getting too technical.

  I am compiling and testing my code with both Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community and MinGW’s g++.

  The point of these tutorials is not to develop parallel algorithms but to gain an understanding of how OpenCL and CUDA work.

  OpenCL-Getting-Started
  ======================

  A small "getting started" tutorial for OpenCL. See
  http://www.eriksmistad.no/getting-started-with-opencl-and-gpu-computing/
  for more info.

  For simplicity, the main.c in this directory does not check for
  errors. If it doesn't work for you, try the version in the
  'errorchecking' subdirectory instead, which does (this was contributed
  by Christian Jaeger.)

  ## Build & development

  To run this project locally you need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
  You also need Ruby, Sass and Compass. Head [over here](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass#compass-task)
  and follow the instructions to set up your environment.

  After you got nodejs, Ruby, Sass and Compass install `grunt` and `bower`:

  ```bash
  $ npm install -g grunt-cli
  $ npm install -g bower
  ```

  Then `cd` into project's directory and run `npm install` and `bower install`.
  This commands will download all required dependencies.

  Now you can run `grunt serve` to start development server.

  ## Firebase
  This project uses [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) as a backend server. While the project is in development stage,
  our data can be changed / deleted / purged or whatever other bad thing can happen. So you can run it on your own 
  instance of Firebase service. Path to Firebase is stored here `app/scripts/angularfire/config.js` in `FBURL` constant.
  You can change it as you need and have your own backend.

  ## Contributing

  Currently the project is in its early stage. All the work is done inside `dev` branch.
