idea1

feeding wavenet implementation in tensorflow simulatenous with the following things to do advanced music gestural recognition:
- elastic fusion dense slam
- audio data + audio advanced gestural recognition  spectral classifiers

plus
- doing training in real time

idea2

implementing the following artificial intelligence model in tensorflow:
- deep convolutional recursive swarm of hybrid bid and artificial neural networks

idea3

idea 4

binding tensorflow to supercollider

idea 5

developing c++ live electronics and algorothmic composition toolbox. should be able to:

- use next generation state of art machine learning algorithmics implemented in tensorflow such as deep convolutional recursive swarm of hybrids bdi and ann;
- using elasticfusion orbit slam2 as an input for gesture recognition by using computer vision;
- using gpgpu driven fft for audio digital signal processing, and gesture recognition, and audio feature extraction;
- computing audio in non real time using complex gpgpu transformations
- using raya as a sound spatialization gpgpu engine
- using unreal engine 4 as the render context for my visuals
