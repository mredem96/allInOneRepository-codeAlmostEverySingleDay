<p>Even here, at that very moment, when I cried glowing wounds to the gods, in which I prostrated myself under the face of the darkness in me, I manifested the desperate sense of who counts the shadows of the face of evil, which is as it says, back in Babylon , Through the seed of the desert, death is the light that glows life. I fall on top of myself, I groan in the darkness, I revolt against everything and everyone, I say evil of myself, I fall under the face of death, as one who wants to miserably bring the divine and megaonic breath of divine acacia. You have no one to share the suffering and the pain you feel, you have fallen on yourself, on life, on love, run in time, quays, you stumble, but never rise, confessed to angels and demons, That in death you find the ultimate meaning of life, which is in the seed of chaos and destruction, which regenerates the sense of the sephirotic pulsar of humanity. That it is in a delinquency of affections eaten up by your own suffering that you show the angels that you are dead.</p>

<p>It is through the flame of memory, it is through the pulsing of that, which can not be expressed, it is through a hermetic catadupe, of feelings in affluence that we are anchored to the divine flame, that regenerates us that gives us life that Frees us from pain, which frees us from death </p>

<p>The jail of life that leads us to death<br/>
Through the cleansing of a graveyard of dreams<br/>
Who break, tear, tie, and are there dead;<br/>
I walk through a black Danube, bound to you<br/>
Through the latent breath in the dawn's gorge<br/>
What is the dietary anaphora between Venus, Saturn and Mercury<br/>
It is a rosette in flames in the mouth of the beast,<br/>
It is the breath of the abyss, it is as much as you tell me,<br/>
As far as you lie to me, so that already there,<br/>
Through the glow of the hours, between<br/>
Dietary vertigo, and arsenic spirals<br/>
Caught up in the mouth of the beast, all there dissemble,<br/>
Everything there is broken, everything there ends.<br/>
I die today, here, between the end of days,<br/>
To be reborn tomorrow, between concealment<br/>
From a sentinel of dead affections between regret<br/></p>

<p>I'm tired of riding in the wind<br/>
To whirl through the clamor of spring<br/>
I'm sick of crying and crying<br/>
Screams of faunal sphinxes and totems.<br/></p>

<p><i>I was there in the darkness, to flee,<br/>
  I sacrographically to the misfortune,<br/>
  From this humble world where I am. I walk through<br/>
  the flame of the desert, Through a gale of sand suit<br/>
  Where I am shockingly shoved For a pulsar of a burning flame<br/></o></p>

  <p><i>Throught the vanity of the absence of lust,<br/>
  I consider the remarkable touch of hedonism<br/>
  Lying in the luciferian call of abadon,<br/>
  So that within sense, I mourn the script<br/>
  Of the Babylonian star dust spiral gazing<br/>
  Throughout the eloquent shimmer of<br/>
  A sense of ktulian meta drama laying<br/>
  Within the mourning exorcisms of angels<br/>
  Lying within the outcome of a star burst<br/></i></p>



  <p><p><i>Do not look at the blow of dissent<br/>
  Do not look at the breath of the ephemeris<br/>
  To the breath of dreamy holocausts,</p>

  <p>Do not look at the breath of vertigo,<br/>
  Do not look at the breath of poison<br/>
  To the breath of that which corrodes you.</p>

  <p>He walks slowly and quietly, walks without anxiety, nor sorrow<br/>
  Walk, because you do not know how much more you can walk</i></p></p>


  <p>I walk frantically through the Danube valleys<br/>
  feeling the calmness in me, as if I hope innocently<br/>
  To return to the genesis from the end of the beginning,<br/>
  the beginning of the end to start it all over again,<br/>
  which is like who says forever and ever<br/></p>

  <p>I burn valleys, mountains, and hills, as someone who says<br/>
  Succate me oxygen so I can not breathe and let me die slowly at your feet.<br/>
  So that in that moment, everything will be quiet everything is numb,<br/>
  everything is content to sound of missing music<br/></p>

Through the glare of the night.<br/>
Between the awakening of the beast.<br/>
Through the frost blow.<br/>
Between valleys and mountains.<br/><br/>

I glimpse you on the horizon.<br/>
I feel the glare of the hours.<br/><br/>

An epitaph of dreams.<br/>
An epitaph of gestures.<br/>
An epitaph of murmurs,<br/>
Words, senses.<br/><br/>

Everything is infinitely black<br/>
Everything is infinitely white.<br/><br/>

Through the tears of eternity.<br/>
Through the hours.<br/><br/>

I glimpse you, I think of you, I remember you.<br/><br/>

from past. Of silence.<br/>
Of innocence. Of the ephemeris.<br/><br/>

Everything resounds gradually.<br/>
To the sound of missing music.<br/><br/>

Gestures. Murmurs<br/>
Meaningless words.<br/>
The running of the days.<br/>
The running of the hours.<br/><br/>

Of minutes. OF seconds.<br/>
In which everything had been said.<br/>
In which everything remained unsaid.<br/><br/>

dream. Aspire. Transpire<br/>
Mechanotronic fluids<br/>
Of the blow of dissent.<br/>
Everything is beautiful. Everything shines.<br/>
Everything is wide. All is life.<br/><br/>

The breath of elegance.<br/>
The breath of regret.<br/>
The breath of the ephemeris<br/>
in me. on thee. Contained.<br/>
There, at that moment.<br/><br/>

I run through valleys and mountains.<br/>
Shut the breath of ice contained in me.<br/>
Shut the breath of the ice contained in you.<br/><br/>

Night (...) gestures (...)<br/>
White (...) hours (...)<br/><br/>

Through the night, dizzy the gestures.<br/>
I look at the white side of the moon, to remind myself<br/>
Of the sense of the hours.<br/><br/>

dizzy spiralling tears.<br/>
ashes of foreign thoughts.<br/>
myriads of spiralburst atoms.<br/>
stems of vanishing dreams.<br/><br/>

i reseamble the outcast of fear.<br/>
i fight throughout a dead road.<br/>
seek answers in bursting angels<br/>
find you in the horizon.<br/><br/>

I run I smile I move.<br/>
At The wind speed.<br/>
At the speed of light.<br/>
At the speed of love.<br/>

Unflagging flame of the ephemeris pulsar<br/>
Meso-vitriolític flame of hours running.<br/>
Babylon from the west that with thy weeping breaths<br/>
Promtheus puslar osiris of osirs breath<br/><br/>

The road is long. The seas whistle.<br/>
The sky howls. The sea breathes<br/><br/>

There were singing songs in praise of you, my goddess.<br/>
Howl flames of the hours running.<br/>
They breathe dielectic currents of the blow of the days.<br/><br/>

Penso. Sinto. Finjo. minto. Penso aquilo que sinto. <br/>
Sinto aquilo que finjo. Minto aquilo que penso.<br/>
A mim mesmo. Ao diabo quiçá. Ao Deus de Ará<br/>
Catadupas de reflexos meta-hieroglíficos esbatem-se<br/>
Pelos pulsares enoquianos do tempo, oxalá.<br/><br/>

Resguardo-me em mim, em ti, em nós. No tempo e no silêncio ali ungido.<br/>
No pulsar eterno do correr das horas E dos dias ali afiados<br/><br/>

Caminho pela noite por entre a projecção<br/>
Da luz sobre o desterro de minha vontade.<br/>
Tudo ressoa por entre o som da estrada fora<br/>
esbatendo em nós vida, amor, esperança<br/><br/>

Spirals of mercury, rosettes in the mouth of the beast.<br/>
I look through the shadow, I see the void of dissent.<br/>
There is in me, in you, in us, life beyond pain,<br/>
Silence beyond hope, so much is this love.<br/>
The love that is the law, the freedom anointed in this chalice<br/>
The loose weather, devoid of this stone deposit<br/>
Do not look at the breath of emptiness and dissent<br/>
Do not walk the road outside, at dawn<br/><br/>
